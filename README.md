# ASR-System

A project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Voice and Sound Signal Processing".

The application was implemented in Matlab. The system proceeds to segment the sentence into words using a mandatory background vs foreground classifier of your choice. From the resulting words, calculate the speaker's fundamental frequency. The system then recognizes each word using only the simple spectrogram as spectral representation. The output produces text with the digits that were recognized. </br> </br>
